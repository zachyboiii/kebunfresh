# KebunFresh - Fresh Produce Delivery App
## Overview
KebunFresh is a collaborative project between Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and Petra Christian University (PCU). This app was developed to solve the problem faced by local vegetable consumers in Surabaya, Indonesia, who have to manually visit different farms to purchase fresh produce. The goal was to simplify the process by connecting buyers with the nearest farms through a convenient and user-friendly app.

## Problem Statement:
As a local vegetable consumer in Surabaya, currently, I have to manually travel to different farms in order to choose my produce. How Might We simplify the process for buyers to locate and purchase fresh crops by connecting them with the nearest farms through a convenient and user-friendly app?

## Solution:
A concept app was designed that provides local stakeholders with potential solutions to this problem, enabling a seamless buying and selling experience for fresh produce.

- **Simple UI/UX Design:** The app features an easy-to-use interface, specifically designed for elderly users to ensure a smooth experience.
- **Web App Prototype:** A rough prototype of the web app is provided to demonstrate how the solution can be implemented.
- **Product Sorting:** Users can sort products based on rating, distance, or price, helping them make informed purchase decisions.

## Technologies Used
